TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES
</h2>

<p>This etext contains a few phrases or lines of Greek text, for example:
<span title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962;</span>. If the mouse is held still over Greek text, a
transliteration in Beta-code appears.</p>

<p>An important feature of this edition is its copious footnotes. Footnote
numbers are shown as small, superscript, bracketed codes in the text.
Each such code is a link to the footnote text. Footnotes indexed with arabic
numbers are informational. Note text in square brackets is the work of
editor E.H. Coleridge, and is unique to this edition. Note text not in brackets
is from earlier editions and is by a preceding editor or Byron himself.</p>

<p>Footnotes indexed with letters document variant forms
of the text from manuscripts and other sources.</p>

<p>In the original, footnotes were printed at the foot of the page on which
they were referenced, and their indices started over on each page. In
this etext, footnotes have been collected at the ends of each preface or
Canto, and have been numbered consecutively throughout. However, in the
blocks of footnotes are numbers in braces: {495}. These represent the
page number on which following footnotes originally appeared. The same
page numbers are also preserved as HTML anchors of the form <i>Note_495</i>.
Thus when the Preface refers to "a note (pp 495-497)," you can locate
that note either by searching the text for {495}, or by
appending <i>#Note_495</i> to the document URL.</p>

<p>Page numbers are shown as small bracketed numbers in the right margin.
These are the page numbers of the text as printed in the original work.
The page numbers are also preserved as anchors of the form <i>Page_123</i>.
Thus you can link or jump to the text from page 123 by appending <i>#Page_123</i> to
the document URL.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0;">The text of this edition of <i>Don Juan</i> has been collated with original
MSS. in the possession of the Lady Dorchester and Mr. John Murray. The
fragment of a Seventeenth Canto, consisting of fourteen stanzas, is now
printed and published for the first time.</p>

<p>I have collated with the original authorities, and in many instances
retranscribed, the numerous quotations from Sir G. Dalzell's <i>Shipwrecks
and Disasters at Sea</i> (1812, 8vo) [Canto II. stanzas xxiv.-civ. pp.
87-112], and from a work entitled <i>Essai sur l'Histoire Ancienne et
Moderne de la Nouvelle Russie</i>, par le Marquis Gabriel de Castelnau
(1827, 8vo) [Canto VII. stanzas ix.&mdash;liii. pp. 304-320, and Canto VIII.
stanzas vi.&mdash;cxxvii. pp. 331-368], which were first included in the
notes to the fifteenth and sixteenth volumes of the edition of 1833, and
have been reprinted in subsequent issues of Lord Byron's <i>Poetical
Works</i>.</p>

A note (pp. 495-497) illustrative of the famous description of Newstead
Abbey (Canto XIII. stanzas lv.-lxxii.) contains particulars not hitherto
published. My thanks and acknowledgments are due to Lady Chermside and
Miss Ethel Webb, for the opportunity afforded me of visiting Newstead
Abbey, and for invaluable assistance in the preparation of this and
other notes.</p>

<p>The proof-sheets of this volume have been read by Mr. Frank E. Taylor. I
am indebted to his care and knowledge for many important corrections and
emendations.</p>

<p>I must once more record my gratitude to Dr. Garnett, C.B., for the
generous manner in which he has devoted time and attention to the
solution of difficulties submitted to his consideration.</p>

<p>I am also indebted, for valuable information, to the Earl of Rosebery,
K.G.; to Mr. J. Willis Clark, Registrar of the University of Cambridge;
to Mr. W.P. Courtney; to my friend Mr. Thomas Hutchinson; to Miss Emily
Jackson, of Hucknall Torkard; and to Mr. T.E. Page, of the Charterhouse.</p>

<p>On behalf of the publisher, I beg to acknowledge the kindness of the
Lady Frances Trevanion, Sir J.G. Tollemache Sinclair, Bart., and Baron
Dimsdale, in permitting the originals of portraits and drawings in their
possession to be reproduced in this volume.</p>

NOTE.
</h3>

<p>
It was intended that the whole of Lord Byron's Poetical Works should be
included in six volumes, corresponding to the six volumes of the
Letters, and announcements to this effect have been made; but this has
been found to be impracticable. The great mass of new material
incorporated in the Introductions, notes, and variants, has already
expanded several of the published volumes to a disproportionate size,
and <i>Don Juan</i> itself occupies 612 pages.</p>

<p>Volume Seven, which will complete the work, will contain Occasional
Poems, Epigrams, etc., a Bibliography more complete than has ever
hitherto been published, and an exhaustive Index.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION_TO_DON_JUAN" id="INTRODUCTION_TO_DON_JUAN"></a>
INTRODUCTION TO <i>DON JUAN</i>
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0;">
Byron was a rapid as well as a voluminous writer. His <i>Tales</i> were
thrown off at lightning speed, and even his dramas were thought out and
worked through with unhesitating energy and rapid achievement.
Nevertheless, the composition of his two great poems was all but
coextensive with his poetical life. He began the first canto of <i>Childe
Harold</i> in the autumn of 1809, and he did not complete the fourth canto
till the spring of 1818. He began the first canto of <i>Don Juan</i> in the
autumn of 1818, and he was still at work on a seventeenth canto in the
spring of 1823. Both poems were issued in parts, and with long intervals
of unequal duration between the parts; but the same result was brought
about by different causes and produced a dissimilar effect. <i>Childe
Harold</i> consists of three distinct poems descriptive of three successive
travels or journeys in foreign lands. The adventures of the hero are but
the pretext for the shifting of the diorama; whereas in <i>Don Juan</i> the
story is continuous, and the scenery is exhibited as a background for
the dramatic evolution of the personality of the hero. <i>Childe Harold</i>
came out at intervals, because there were periods when the author was
stationary; but the interruptions in the composition and publication of
<i>Don Juan</i> were due to the disapproval and discouragement of friends,
and the very natural hesitation and procrastination of the publisher.
Canto I. was written in September, 1818; Canto II. in December-January,
1818-1819. Both cantos were published on July 15, 1819. Cantos III., IV.
were written in the winter of 1819-1820; Canto V., after an interval of
nine months, in October-November, 1820, but the publication of Cantos
III., IV., V. was delayed till August 8, 1821. The next interval was
longer still, but it was the last. In June, 1822, Byron began to work at
a sixth, and by the end of March, 1823, he had completed a sixteenth
canto. But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span> publication of these later cantos, which had been
declined by Murray, and were finally entrusted to John Hunt, was spread
over a period of several months. Cantos VI., VII., VIII., with a
Preface, were published July 15; Cantos IX., X., XI, August 29; Cantos
XII., XIII., XIV., December 17, 1823; and, finally, Cantos XV., XVI.,
March 26, 1824. The composition of <i>Don Juan</i>, considered as a whole,
synchronized with the composition of all the dramas (except <i>Manfred</i>)
and the following poems: <i>The Prophecy of Dante</i>, (the translation of)
<i>The Morgante Maggiore, The Vision of Judgment, The Age of Bronze</i>, and
<i>The Island</i>.</p>

<p>There is little to be said with regard to the "Sources" of <i>Don Juan</i>.
Frere's <i>Whistlecraft</i> had suggested <i>Beppo</i>, and, at the same time, had
prompted and provoked a sympathetic study of Frere's Italian models,
Berni and Pulci (see "Introduction to <i>Beppo</i>," <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1901,
iv. 155-158; and "Introduction to <i>The Morgante Maggiore</i>" ibid., pp.
279-281); and, again, the success of <i>Beppo</i>, and, still more, a sense
of inspiration and the conviction that he had found the path to
excellence, suggested another essay of the <i>ottava rima</i>, a humorous
poem "<i>&agrave; la Beppo</i>" on a larger and more important scale. If Byron
possessed more than a superficial knowledge of the legendary "Don Juan,"
he was irresponsive and unimpressed. He speaks (letter to Murray,
February 16, 1821) of "the Spanish tradition;" but there is nothing to
show that he had read or heard of Tirso de Molina's (Gabriel Tellez) <i>El
Burlador de Sevilla y Convidado de Piedra</i> (<i>The Deceiver of Seville and
the Stone Guest</i>), 1626, which dramatized the "ower true tale" of the
actual Don Juan Tenorio; or that he was acquainted with any of the
Italian (e.g. <i>Convitato di Pietra</i>, del Dottor Giacinto Andrea
Cicognini, Fiorentino [see L. Allacci <i>Dramaturgia</i>, 1755, 4&ordm;, p. 862])
or French adaptations of the legend (<i>e.g</i>. <i>Le Festin de Pierre, ou le
fils criminel</i>, Tragi-com&eacute;die de De Villiers, 1659; and Moli&egrave;re's <i>Dom
Juan, ou Le Festin de Pierre</i>, 1665). He had seen (<i>vide post</i>, <a href="#Footnote_15">p. 11,
note 2</a>) Delpini's pantomime, which was based on Shadwell's <i>Libertine</i>,
and he may have witnessed, at Milan or Venice, a performance of Mozart's
<i>Don Giovanni</i>; but in taking Don Juan for his "hero," he took the name
only, and disregarded the "terrible figure" "of the Titan of embodied
evil, the likeness of sin made flesh" (see <i>Selections from the Works of
Lord Byron</i>, by A.C. Swinburne, 1885, p. xxvi.), "as something to his
purpose nothing"!</p>

<p>Why, then, did he choose the name, and what was the scheme or motif of
his poem? Something is to be gathered from his own remarks and
reflections; but it must be borne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span> in mind that he is on the defensive,
and that his half-humorous paradoxes were provoked by advice and
opposition. Writing to Moore (September 19, 1818), he says, "I have
finished the first canto ... of a poem in the style and manner of
<i>Beppo</i>, encouraged by the good success of the same. It is ... meant to
be a little quietly facetious upon every thing. But I doubt whether it
is not&mdash;at least as far as it has gone&mdash;too free for these very modest
days." The critics before and after publication thought that <i>Don Juan</i>
<i>was</i> "too free," and, a month after the two first cantos had been
issued, he writes to Murray (August 12, 1819), "You ask me for the plan
of Donny Johnny; I <i>have</i> no plan&mdash;I <i>had</i> no plan; but I had or have
materials.... You are too earnest and eager about a work never intended
to be serious. Do you suppose that I could have any intention but to
giggle and make giggle?&mdash;a playful satire, with as little poetry as
could be helped, was what I meant." Again, after the completion but
before the publication of Cantos III., IV., V., in a letter to Murray
(February 16, 1821), he writes, "The Fifth is so far from being the last
of <i>Don Juan</i>, that it is hardly the beginning. I meant to take him the
tour of Europe, with a proper mixture of siege, battle, and adventure,
and to make him finish as Anacharsis Cloots in the French Revolution....
I meant to have made him a <i>Cavalier Servente</i> in Italy, and a cause for
a divorce in England, and a Sentimental 'Werther-faced' man in Germany,
so as to show the different ridicules of the society in each of these
countries, and to have displayed him gradually <i>g&acirc;t&eacute;</i> and <i>blas&eacute;</i>, as he
grew older, as is natural. But I had not quite fixed whether to make him
end in Hell, or in an unhappy marriage, not knowing which would be the
severest."</p>

<p>Byron meant what he said, but he kept back the larger truth. Great
works, in which the poet speaks <i>ex animo</i>, and the man lays bare the
very pulse of the machine, are not conceived or composed unconsciously
and at haphazard. Byron did not "whistle" <i>Don Juan</i> "for want of
thought." He had found a thing to say, and he meant to make the world
listen. He had read with angry disapproval, but he had read, Coleridge's
<i>Critique on</i> [Maturin's] <i>Bertram</i> (<i>vide post</i>, <a href="#Footnote_2">p. 4, note 1</a>), and, it
may be, had caught an inspiration from one brilliant sentence which
depicts the Don Juan of the legend somewhat after the likeness of Childe
Harold, if not of Lord Byron: "Rank, fortune, wit, talent, acquired
knowledge, and liberal accomplishments, with beauty of person, vigorous
health, ... all these advantages, elevated by the habits and sympathies
of noble birth and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>natural character, are ... combined in Don Juan, so
as to give him the means of carrying into all its practical consequences
the doctrine of a godless nature ... Obedience to nature is the only
virtue." Again, "It is not the wickedness of Don Juan ... which
constitutes the character an abstraction, ... but the rapid succession
of the correspondent acts and incidents, his intellectual superiority,
and the splendid accumulation of his gifts and desirable qualities as
coexistent with entire wickedness in one and the same person." Here was
at once a suggestion and a challenge.</p>

<p>Would it not be possible to conceive and to depict an ideal character,
gifted, gracious, and delightful, who should "carry into all its
practical consequences" the doctrine of a mundane, if not godless
doctrine, and, at the same time, retain the charities and virtues of
uncelestial but not devilish manhood? In defiance of monition and in
spite of resolution, the primrose path is trodden by all sorts and
conditions of men, sinners no doubt, but not necessarily abstractions of
sin, and to assert the contrary makes for cant and not for
righteousness. The form and substance of the poem were due to the
compulsion of Genius and the determination of Art, but the argument is a
vindication of the natural man. It is Byron's "criticism of life." <i>Don
Juan</i> was <i>taboo</i> from the first. The earlier issues of the first five
cantos were doubly anonymous. Neither author nor publisher subscribed
their names on the title-page. The book was a monster, and, as its maker
had foreseen, "all the world" shuddered. Immoral, in the sense that it
advocates immoral tenets, or prefers evil to good, it is not, but it is
unquestionably a dangerous book, which (to quote Kingsley's words used
in another connection) "the young and innocent will do well to leave
altogether unread." It is dangerous because it ignores resistance and
presumes submission to passion; it is dangerous because, as Byron
admitted, it is "now and then voluptuous;" and it is dangerous, in a
lesser degree, because, here and there, the purport of the quips and
allusions is gross and offensive. No one can take up the book without
being struck and arrested by these violations of modesty and decorum;
but no one can master its contents and become possessed of it as a whole
without perceiving that the mirror is held up to nature, that it
reflects spots and blemishes which, on a survey of the vast and various
orb, dwindle into <i>natural</i> and so comparative insignificance. Byron was
under no delusion as to the grossness of <i>Don Juan</i>. His plea or
pretence, that he was sheltered by the superior grossness of Ariosto and
La Fontaine, of Prior and of Fielding, is <i>nihil ad rem</i>, if it is not
insincere. When Murray (May 3, 1819) charges him with "approximations to
indelicacy,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span> he laughs himself away at the euphemism, but when Hobhouse
and "the Zoili of Albemarle Street" talked to him "about morality," he
flames out, "I maintain that it is the most moral of poems." He looked
upon his great work as a whole, and he knew that the "<i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of
his song" was not only to celebrate, but, by the white light of truth,
to represent and exhibit the great things of the world&mdash;Love and War,
and Death by sea and land, and Man, half-angel, half-demon&mdash;the comedy
of his fortunes, and the tragedy of his passions and his fate.</p>

<p><i>Don Juan</i> has won great praise from the great. Sir Walter Scott
(<i>Edinburgh Weekly Journal</i>, May 19, 1824) maintained that its creator
"has embraced every topic of human life, and sounded every string of the
divine harp, from its slightest to its most powerful and
heart-astounding tones." Goethe (<i>Kunst und Alterthum</i>, 1821 [ed.
Weimar, iii. 197, and <i>S&auml;mmtliche Werke</i>, xiii. 637]) described <i>Don
Juan</i> as "a work of boundless genius." Shelley (letter to Byron, October
21, 1821), on the receipt of Cantos III., IV., V., bore testimony to his
"wonder and delight:" "This poem carries with it at once the stamp of
originality and defiance of imitation. Nothing has ever been written
like it in English, nor, if I may venture to prophesy, will there be,
unless carrying upon it the mark of a secondary and borrowed light....
You are building up a drama," he adds, "such as England has not yet
seen, and the task is sufficiently noble and worthy of you." Again, of
the fifth canto he writes (Shelley's <i>Prose Works</i>, ed. H. Buxton
Forman, iv. 219), "Every word has the stamp of immortality.... It
fulfils, in a certain degree, what I have long preached of
producing&mdash;something wholly new and relative to the age, and yet
surpassingly beautiful." Finally, a living poet, neither a disciple nor
encomiast of Byron, pays eloquent tribute to the strength and splendour
of <i>Don Juan</i>: "Across the stanzas ... we swim forward as over the
'broad backs of the sea;' they break and glitter, hiss and laugh, murmur
and move like waves that sound or that subside. There is in them a
delicious resistance, an elastic motion, which salt water has and fresh
water has not. There is about them a wide wholesome air, full of vivid
light and constant wind, which is only felt at sea. Life undulates and
Death palpitates in the splendid verse.... This gift of life and variety
is the supreme quality of Byron's chief poem" (<i>A Selection, etc.</i>, by
A.C. Swinburne, 1885, p. x.).</p>

consequence of Hobhouse's article in the <i>Westminster Review</i>, 1824. He
adds, for Southey's consolation and encouragement, that "for several
years the verses have been selling in the streets as a broadside," and
that "it would serve no purpose to exclude them on the present
occasion." But Southey was not appeased. He tells Allan Cunningham (June
3, 1833) that "the new edition of Byron's works is ... one of the very
worst symptoms of these bad times" (<i>Life and Correspondence</i>, 1850, vi.

nature, as the sole ground and efficient cause not only of all things,
events, and appearances, but likewise of all our thoughts, sensations,
impulses, and actions. Obedience to nature is the only virtue." It is
possible that Byron traced his own lineaments in this too life-like
portraiture, and at the same time conceived the possibility of a new Don
Juan, "made up" after his own likeness. His extreme resentment at
Coleridge's just, though unwise and uncalled-for, attack on Maturin
stands in need of some explanation. See letter to Murray, September 17,
1817 (<i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv. 172).] </p></div>

was an abbreviated and bowdlerized version of Shadwell's <i>Libertine</i>.
"First produced by Mr. Garrick on the boards of Drury Lane Theatre," it
was recomposed by Charles Anthony Delpini, and performed at the Royalty
Theatre, in Goodman's Fields, in 1787. It was entitled <i>Don Juan; or,
The Libertine Destroyed</i>: A Tragic Pantomimical Entertainment, In Two
Acts. Music Composed by Mr. Gluck. "Scaramouch," the "Sganarelle" of
Moli&egrave;re's <i>Festin de Pierre</i>, was a favourite character of Joseph
Grimaldi. He was cast for the part, in 1801, at Sadler's Wells, and,
again, on a memorable occasion, November 28, 1809, at Covent Garden
Theatre, when the O.P. riots were in full swing, and (see the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>, November 29, 1809) "there was considerable tumult in the
pit." According to "Boz" (<i>Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi</i>, 1846, ii. 81,
106, 107), Byron patronized Grimaldi's "benefits at Covent Garden," was
repeatedly in his company, and when he left England, in 1816, "presented
him with a valuable silver snuff-box." At the end of the pantomime "the
Furies gather round him [Don Juan], and the Tyrant being bound in chains
is hurried away and thrown into flames." The Devil is conspicuous by his
absence.]</p></div>

canons of criticism, delivered at the Surrey Institution (<i>The English
Poets</i>, 1870, pp. 203, 204), I am accused of having 'lauded Buonaparte
to the skies in the hour of his success, and then peevishly wreaking my
disappointment on the god of my idolatry.' The first lines I ever wrote
upon Buonaparte were the 'Ode to Napoleon,' after his abdication in
1814. All that I have ever written on that subject has been done since
his decline;&mdash;I never 'met him in the hour of his success.' I have
considered his character at different periods, in its strength and in
its weakness: by his zealots I am accused of injustice&mdash;by his enemies
as his warmest partisan, in many publications, both English and foreign.
</p><p>
"For the accuracy of my delineation I have high authority. A year and
some months ago, I had the pleasure of seeing at Venice my friend the
honourable Douglas Kinnaird. In his way through Germany, he told me that
he had been honoured with a presentation to, and some interviews with,
one of the nearest family connections of Napoleon (Eug&egrave;ne Beauharnais).
During one of these, he read and translated the lines alluding to
Buonaparte, in the Third Canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>. He informed me, that
he was authorized by the illustrious personage&mdash;(still recognized as
such by the Legitimacy in Europe)&mdash;to whom they were read, to say, <i>that
'the delineation was complete,'</i> or words to this effect. It is no
puerile vanity which induces me to publish this fact;&mdash;but Mr. Hazlitt
accuses my inconsistency, and infers my inaccuracy. Perhaps he will
admit that, with regard to the latter, one of the most intimate family
connections of the Emperor may be equally capable of deciding on the
subject. I tell Mr. Hazlitt that I never flattered Napoleon on the
throne, nor maligned him since his fall. I wrote what I think are the
incredible antitheses of his character.
</p><p>
"Mr. Hazlitt accuses me further of delineating <i>myself</i> in <i>Childe
Harold</i>, etc., etc. I have denied this long ago&mdash;but, even were it true,
Locke tells us, that all his knowledge of human understanding was
derived from studying his own mind. From Mr. Hazlitt's opinion of my
poetry I do not appeal; but I request that gentleman not to insult me by
imputing the basest of crimes,&mdash;viz. 'praising publicly the same man
whom I wished to depreciate in his adversity:'&mdash;the <i>first</i> lines I ever
wrote on Buonaparte were in his dispraise, in 1814,&mdash;the <i>last</i>, though
not at all in his favour, were more impartial and discriminative, in
1818. Has he become more fortunate since 1814?" For Byron's various
estimates of Napoleon's character and career, see <i>Childe Harold</i>, Canto
III, stanza xxxvi. line 7, <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1899, ii. 238, note 1.]</p></div>

"was surprised one day by a Doctor and a Lawyer almost forcing
themselves at the same time into my room. I did not know," he adds,
"till afterwards the real object of their visit. I thought their
questions singular, frivolous, and somewhat importunate, if not
impertinent: but what should I have thought, if I had known that they
were sent to provide proofs of my insanity?" Lady Byron, in her <i>Remarks
on Mr. Moore's Life, etc</i>. (<i>Life</i>, pp. 661-663), says that Dr. Baillie
(<i>vide post</i>, <a href="#Footnote_545">p. 412, note 2</a>), whom she consulted with regard to her
husband's supposed insanity, "not having had access to Lord Byron, could
not pronounce a positive opinion on this point." It appears, however,
that another doctor, a Mr. Le Mann (see <i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 293, note
1, 295, 299, etc.), visited Byron professionally, and reported on his
condition to Lady Byron. Hence, perhaps, the mention of "druggists."]</p></div>

</p><p>
The text is based on a second or revised copy of stanzas cxc.-cxcviii.
Many of the corrections and emendations which were inserted in the first
draft are omitted in the later and presumably improved version. Byron's
first intention was to insert seven stanzas after stanza clxxxix.,
descriptive and highly depreciatory of Brougham, but for reasons of
"fairness" (<i>vide infra</i>) he changed his mind. The casual mention of
"blundering Brougham" in <i>English Bards, etc.</i> (line 524, <i>Poetical
Works</i>, 1898, i. 338, note 2), is a proof that his suspicions were not
aroused as to the authorship of the review of <i>Hours of Idleness</i>
(<i>Edin. Rev.</i>, January, 1808), and it is certain that Byron's animosity
was due to the part played by Brougham at the time of the Separation.
(In a letter to Byron, dated February 18, 1817, Murray speaks of a
certain B. "as your incessant persecutor&mdash;the source of all affected
public opinion respecting you.") The stanzas, with the accompanying
notes, are not included in the editions of 1833 or 1837, and are now

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Distrusted by the Democracy, disliked by the Whigs, and detested
by the Tories, too much of a lawyer for the people, and too much of
a demagogue for Parliament, a contestor of counties, and a
Candidate for cities, the refuse of half the Electors of England,
and representative at last upon sufferance of the proprietor of
some rotten borough, which it would have been more independent to
have purchased, a speaker upon all questions, and the outcast of
all parties, his support has become alike formidable to all his
enemies (for he has no friends), and his vote can be only valuable
when accompanied by his Silence. A disappointed man with a bad
temper, he is endowed with considerable but not first-rate
abilities, and has blundered on through life, remarkable only for a
fluency, in which he has many rivals at the bar and in the Senate,
and an eloquence in which he has several Superiors. 'Willing to
wound and <i>not</i> afraid to strike, until he receives a blow in
return, he has not yet betrayed any illegal ardour, or Irish
alacrity, in accepting the defiances, and resenting the disgraceful
terms which his proneness to evil-speaking have (sic) brought upon
him. In the cases of Mackinnon and Manners,<a href="#FN_XXE" id="XXE">[E]</a> he sheltered himself
behind those parliamentary privileges, which Fox, Pitt, Canning,
Castlereagh, Tierney, Adam, Shelburne, Grattan, Corry, Curran, and
Clare disdained to adopt as their buckler. The House of Commons
became the Asylum of his Slander, as the Churches of Rome were once
the Sanctuary of Assassins.
</p><p>
"His literary reputation (with the exception of one work of his
early career) rests upon some anonymous articles imputed to him in
a celebrated periodical work; but even these are surpassed by the
Essays of others in the same Journal. He has tried every thing and
succeeded in nothing; and he may perhaps finish as a Lawyer without
practice, as he has already been occasionally an orator without an
audience, if not soon cut short in his career.
</p><p>
"The above character is <i>not</i> written impartially, but by one who
has had occasion to know some of the baser parts of it, and regards
him accordingly with shuddering abhorrence, and just so much fear
as he deserves. In him is to be dreaded the crawling of the
centipede, not the spring of the tiger&mdash;the venom of the reptile,
not the strength of the animal&mdash;the rancour of the miscreant, not
the courage of the Man.
</p><p>
"In case the prose or verse of the above should be actionable, I
put my name, that the man may rather proceed against me than the
publisher&mdash;not without some faint hope that the brand with which I
blast him may induce him, however reluctantly, to a manlier

been, that I have never had an opportunity since I was aware of the
facts, which my friends had carefully concealed from me; and it was
only by slow degrees, and by piecemeal, that I got at them. I have
not sought him, nor gone out of my way for him; but I will <i>find</i>
him, and then we can have it out: he has shown so little courage,
that he <i>must</i> fight at last in his absolute necessity to escape
utter degradation.

Coleridge fiercely and venomously, because he believed that his
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> had accepted patronage and money, and, notwithstanding, had
retailed scandalous statements to the detriment and dishonour of his
advocate and benefactor (see letter to Murray, November 24, 1818,
<i>Letters</i>, 1900, iv. 272; and "Introduction to the <i>Vision of Judgment,"
Poetical Works</i>, 1901, iv. 475). Byron does not substantiate his charge
of ingratitude, and there is nothing to show whether Coleridge ever knew
why a once friendly countenance was changed towards him. He might have
asked, with the Courtenays, <i>Ubi lapsus, quid feci?</i> If Byron had been
on his mind or his conscience he would have drawn up an elaborate
explanation or apology; but nothing of the kind is extant. He took the
abuse as he had taken the favours&mdash;for the unmerited gifts of the blind
goddess Fortune. (See, too, <i>Letter</i> ..., by John Bull, 1821, p. 14.)]</p></div>

stone equal in weight to six millions of tons, which is just three times
that of the vast Breakwater thrown across Plymouth Sound; and, to render
this precious dust still more secure, the narrow chamber was made
accessible only by small, intricate passages, obstructed by stones of an
enormous weight, and so carefully closed externally as not to be
perceptible.&mdash;Yet, how vain are all the precautions of man! Not a bone

caused, in the greatest height of the danger, <i>his embroidered coat and
his red scarf</i> to be brought to him, saying, that a true Spaniard ought
to die bearing his King's Marks of distinction. He sat himself down in a
great elbow chair, and with his foot struck a poor Neapolitan in the
chops, who, not being able to stand upon the Coursey of the Galley, was
crawling along, crying out aloud, <i>'Sennor Don Fernando, por l'amor de
Dios, Confession.'</i> The captain, when he struck him, said to him,
<i>'Inimigo de Dios piedes Confession!'</i> And as I was representing to him,
that his inference was not right, he said that that old man gave offence
to the whole galley. You can't imagine the horror of a great storm; you
can as little imagine the Ridicule mixed with it. A Sicilian
Observantine monk was preaching at the foot of the great mast, that St.

[Mary Powell did not "run away," but at the end of the honeymoon
obtained her husband's consent to visit her family at Shotover, "upon a

own, or from people I knew. By the way, much of the description of the

this</i>), and the rest from my own observation. Remember, I never meant to
conceal this at all, and have only not stated it, because <i>Don Juan</i> had
no preface, nor name to it."&mdash;Letter to Murray, August 23, 1821,
<i>Letters</i>, 1901, v. 346.
</p><p>
The first edition of <i>"Tully's Tripoli"</i> is entitled <i>Narrative of a Ten
Years' Residence in Tripoli In Africa: From the original correspondence
in the possession of the Family of the late Richard Tully, Esq., the
British Consul</i>, 1816, 410. The book is in the form of letters (so says
the <i>Preface</i>) written by the Consul's sister. The description of
Haid&eacute;e's <i>dress</i> is taken from the account of a visit to Lilla Kebbiera,
the wife of the Bashaw (p. 30); the description of the furniture and
refreshments from the account of a visit to "Lilla Amnani," Hadgi
Abderrahmam's Greek wife (pp. 132-137). It is evident that the "Chiel"
who took <i>these</i> "notes" was the Consul's <i>sister</i>, not the Consul:
"Lilla Aisha, the Bey's wife, is thought to be very sensible, though
rather haughty. Her apartments were grand, and herself superbly habited.
Her chemise was covered with gold embroidery at the neck; over it she
wore a gold and silver tissue <i>jileck</i>, or jacket without sleeves, and
over that another of purple velvet richly laced with gold, with coral
and pearl buttons set quite close together down the front; it had short
sleeves finished with a gold band not far below the shoulder, and
discovered a wide loose chemise of transparent gauze, with gold, silver,
and ribband strips. She wore round her ancles ... a sort of fetter made
of a thick bar of gold so fine that they bound it round the leg with one
hand; it is an inch and a half wide, and as much in thickness: each of
these weighs four pounds. Just above this a band three inches wide of
gold thread finished the ends of a pair of trousers made of pale yellow
and white silk."
</p><p>
Page 132. "[Lilla] rose to take coffee, which was served in very small
china cups, placed in silver filigree cups; and gold filigree cups were
put under those presented to the married ladies. They had introduced
cloves, cinnamon, and saffron into the coffee, which was abundantly
sweetened; but this mixture was very soon changed, and replaced by
excellent simple coffee for the European ladies...."
</p><p>
Page 133. "The Greek then shewed us the gala furniture of her own
room.... The hangings of the room were of tapestry, made in pannels of
different coloured velvets, thickly inlaid with flowers of silk damask;
a yellow border, of about a foot in depth, finished the tapestry at top
and bottom, the upper border being embroidered with Moorish sentences
from the Koran in lilac letters. The carpet was of crimson satin, with a
deep border of pale blue quilted; this is laid over Indian mats and
other carpets. In the best part of the room the sofa is placed, which
occupies three sides in an alcove, the floor of which is raised. The
sofa and the cushions that lay around were of crimson velvet, the centre
cushions were embroidered with a sun in gold of highly embossed work,
the rest were of gold and silver tissue. The curtains of the alcove were
made to match those before the bed. A number of looking-glasses, and a
profusion of fine china and chrystal completed the ornaments and
furniture of the room, in which were neither tables nor chairs. A small
table, about six inches high, is brought in when refreshments are
served; it is of ebony, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, tortoiseshell,
ivory, gold and silver, of choice woods, or of plain mahogany, according
to the circumstances of the proprietor."
</p><p>
Page 136. "On the tables were placed all sorts of refreshments, and
thirty or forty dishes of meat and poultry, dressed different ways;
there were no knives nor forks, and only a few spoons of gold, silver,
ivory, or coral...."
</p><p>
Page 137. "The beverage was various sherbets, some composed of the juice
of boiled raisins, very sweet; some of the juice of pomegranates
squeezed through the rind; and others of the pure juice of oranges.
These sherbets were copiously supplied in high glass ewers, placed in
great numbers on the ground.... After the dishes of meat were removed, a
dessert of Arabian fruits, confectionaries, and sweetmeats was served;
among the latter was the date-bread. This sweetmeat is made in
perfection only by the blacks at Fezzan, of the ripe date of the
country.... They make it in the shape of loaves, weighing from twenty to
thirty pounds; the stones of the fruit are taken out, and the dates
simply pressed together with great weights; thus preserved, it keeps
perfectly good for a year."]</p></div>

Stephen Fricker, who had been an innkeeper, and afterwards a potter at
Bristol, migrated to Bath about the year 1780. For the last six years of
his life he was owner and manager of a coal wharf. He had inherited a
small fortune, and his wife brought him money, but he died bankrupt, and
left his family destitute. His widow returned to Bristol, and kept a
school. In a letter to Murray, dated September 11, 1822 (<i>Letters</i>,
1901, vi. 113), Byron quotes the authority of "Luttrell," and "his
friend Mr. Nugent," for the statement that Mrs. Southey and "Coleridge's
Sara ... before they were married ... were milliner's or dressmaker's
apprentices." The story rests upon their evidence. It is certain that in
1794, when Coleridge appeared upon the scene, the sisters earned their
living by going out to work in the houses of friends, and were not, at
that time, "milliners of Bath."]</p></div>

highly, but he is not a poetical genius. The only qualities I can find
in Dryden that are <i>essentially</i> poetical, are a certain ardour and

him on an operatic excursion; part to form the opera, and part the
ballet. He contrived to get them on board a vessel, which took them to
Janina, where he sold them for the basest purposes. Some died from the
effect of the climate, and some from suffering. Among the few who
returned were a Signor Molinari, and a female dancer named Bonfiglia,
who afterwards became the wife of Crespi, the tenor singer. The wretch

the appreciation of great poetry is a plant of slow growth, that
immediate recognition is a mark of inferiority, or is to be accounted
for by the presence of adventitious qualities: "So strange, indeed, are
the obliquities of admiration, that they whose opinions are much
influenced by authority will often be tempted to think that there are no
fixed principles in human nature for this art to rest upon.... Away,
then, with the senseless iteration of the word <i>popular!</i> ... The voice
that issues from this spirit [of human knowledge] is that <i>Vox Populi</i>
which the Deity inspires. Foolish must he be who can mistake for this a
local acclamation, or a transitory outcry&mdash;transitory though it be for
years, local though from a Nation. Still more lamentable is his error
who can believe that there is anything of divine infallibility in this
clamour of that small though loud portion of the community ever governed
by factitious influence, which under the name of the <span class="smcap">Public</span>, passes
itself upon the unthinking for the <span class="smcap">People</span>." Naturally enough Byron
regarded this pronouncement as a taunt if not as a challenge.
Wordsworth's noble appeal from a provincial to an imperial authority,
from the present to the future, is not strengthened by the obvious
reference to the popularity of contemporaries.]</p></div>

of December, 1820, in the streets of Ravenna, not a hundred paces from
the residence of the writer. The circumstances were as described.
</p><p>
["December 9, 1820. I open my letter to tell you a fact, which will show
the state of this country better than I can. The commandant of the
troops is <i>now</i> lying <i>dead</i> in my house. He was shot at a little past
eight o'clock, about two hundred paces from my door. I was putting on my
great coat to visit Madame la Comtessa G., when I heard the shot. On
coming into the hall, I found all my servants on the balcony, exclaiming
that a man was murdered. I immediately ran down, calling on Tita (the
bravest of them) to follow me. The rest wanted to hinder us from going,
as it is the custom for everybody here, it seems, to run away from 'the
stricken deer.' ... we found him lying on his back, almost, if not
quite, dead, with five wounds; one in the heart, two in the stomach, one
in the finger, and the other in the arm. Some soldiers cocked their
guns, and wanted to hinder me from passing. However, we passed, and I
found Diego, the adjutant, crying over him like a child&mdash;a surgeon, who
said nothing of his profession&mdash;a priest, sobbing a frightened
prayer&mdash;and the commandant, all this time, on his back, on the hard,
cold pavement, without light or assistance, or anything around him but
confusion and dismay. As nobody could, or would, do anything but howl
and pray, and as no one would stir a finger to move him, for fear of
consequences, I lost my patience&mdash;made my servant and a couple of the
mob take up the body&mdash;sent off two soldiers to the guard&mdash;despatched
Diego to the Cardinal with the news, and had him carried upstairs into
my own quarters. But it was too late&mdash;he was gone.... I had him partly
stripped&mdash;made the surgeon examine him, and examined him myself. He had
been shot by cut balls or slugs. I felt one of the slugs, which had gone
through him, all but the skin.... He only said, 'O Dio!' and 'Gesu!' two
or three times, and appeared to have suffered little. Poor fellow! he
was a brave officer; but had made himself much disliked by the
people."&mdash;Letter to Moore, December 9, 1820, <i>Letters,</i> 1901, v. 133.

essay on "Empire" (Essays, No. xx.), hints that Solyman was the last of
his line; on what authority, I know not. These are his words: "The
destruction of Mustapha was so fatal to Solyman's line; as the
succession of the Turks from Solyman until this day is suspected to be
untrue, and of strange blood; for that Selymus the second was thought to
be supposititious." But Bacon, in his historical authorities, is often
inaccurate. I could give half a dozen instances from his Apophthegms
only.

of the Othman Empire</i> (translated by N. Tyndal, 1734); nor <i>The Turkish
History</i> (written by Mr. Knolles, 1701), cast any doubts on his
legitimacy. Byron complained of the omission from the notes to the first
edition of Don Juan, of his corrections of Bacon's "Apophthegms" (see

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> details of the siege of Ismail in two of the following cantos
(<i>i.e.</i> the seventh and eighth) are taken from a French Work, entitled
<i>Histoire de la Nouvelle Russie.</i><a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Some of the incidents attributed
to Don Juan really occurred, particularly the circumstance of his saving
the infant, which was the actual case of the late Duc de Richelieu, then
a young volunteer in the Russian service, and afterward the founder and
benefactor of Odessa, where his name and memory can never cease to be
regarded with reverence.</p>

<p>In the course of these cantos, a stanza or two will be found relative to
the late Marquis of Londonderry,<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> but written some time before his
decease. Had that person's oligarchy died with him, they would have been
suppressed; as it is, I am aware of nothing in the manner of his death
or of his life to prevent the free expression of the opinions of all
whom his whole existence was consumed in endeavouring to enslave. That
he was an amiable man in <i>private</i> life, may or may not be true: but
with this the public have nothing to do; and as to lamenting his death,
it will be time enough when Ireland has ceased to mourn for his birth.
As a minister, I, for one of millions, looked upon him as the most
despotic in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span> intention, and the weakest in intellect, that ever
tyrannised over a country. It is the first time indeed since the Normans
that England has been insulted by a <i>minister</i> (at least) who could not
speak English, and that Parliament permitted itself to be dictated to in
the language of Mrs. Malaprop.</p>

<p>Of the manner of his death little need be said, except that if a poor
radical, such as Waddington or Watson,<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> had cut his throat, he would
have been buried in a cross-road, with the usual appurtenances of the
stake and mallet. But the minister was an elegant lunatic&mdash;a sentimental
suicide&mdash;he merely cut the "carotid artery," (blessings on their
learning!) and lo! the pageant, and the Abbey! and "the syllables of
dolour yelled forth"<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> by the newspapers&mdash;and the harangue of the
Coroner in a eulogy over the bleeding body of the deceased&mdash;(an Anthony
worthy of such a C&aelig;sar)&mdash;and the nauseous and atrocious cant of a
degraded crew of conspirators against all that is sincere and
honourable. In his death he was necessarily one of two things by the
law<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>&mdash;a felon or a madman&mdash;and

In his life he was&mdash;what all the world knows, and half of it will feel
for years to come, unless his death prove a "moral lesson" to the
surviving Sejani<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> of Europe. It may at least serve as some
consolation to the nations, that their oppressors are not happy, and in
some instances judge so justly of their own actions as to anticipate the
sentence of mankind. Let us hear no more of this man; and let Ireland

<p>With regard to the objections which have been made on another score to
the already published cantos of this poem, I shall content myself with
two quotations from Voltaire:&mdash;"La pudeur s'est enfuite des coeurs, et
s'est refugi&eacute;e sur les l&egrave;vres." ... "Plus les moeurs sont d&eacute;prav&eacute;s, plus
les expressions deviennent mesur&eacute;es; on croit regagner en langage ce
qu'on a perdu en vertu."</p>

<p>This is the real fact, as applicable to the degraded and hypocritical
mass which leavens the present English generation, and is the only
answer they deserve. The hackneyed and lavished title of
Blasphemer&mdash;which, with Radical, Liberal, Jacobin, Reformer, etc., are
the changes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> which the hirelings are daily ringing in the ears of those
who will listen&mdash;should be welcome to all who recollect on <i>whom</i> it was
originally bestowed. Socrates and Jesus Christ were put to death
publicly as <i>blasphemers</i>, and so have been and may be many who dare to
oppose the most notorious abuses of the name of God and the mind of man.
But persecution is not refutation, nor even triumph: the "wretched
infidel," as he is called, is probably happier in his prison than the
proudest of his assailants. With his opinions I have nothing to do&mdash;they
may be right or wrong&mdash;but he has suffered for them, and that very
suffering for conscience' sake will make more proselytes to deism than
the example of heterodox<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> Prelates to Christianity, suicide
statesmen to oppression, or overpensioned homicides to the impious
alliance which insults the world with the name of "Holy!"<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> I have no
wish to trample on the dishonoured or the dead; but it would be well if
the adherents to the classes from whence those persons sprung should
abate a little of the cant which is the crying sin of this
double-dealing and false-speaking time of selfish spoilers, and&mdash;&mdash;but
enough for the present.</p>

of Kent, addressed the jury at some length. The following sentences are
taken from the report of the inquest, contained in <i>The Annual Biography
and Obituary for the year 1823</i>, vol. vii. p. 57: "As a public man, it
is impossible for me to weigh his character in any scales that I can
hold. In private life I believe the world will admit that a more amiable
man could not be found.... If it should unfortunately appear that there
is not sufficient evidence to prove what is generally considered the
indication of a disordered mind, I trust that the jury will pay some
attention to my humble opinion, which is, that no man can be in his
proper senses at the moment he commits so rash an act as self-murder.
...The Bible declares that a man clings to nothing so strongly as his
own life, I therefore view it as an axiom, and an abstract principle,
that a man must necessarily be out of his mind at the moment of
destroying himself." Byron, probably, read the report of the inquest in
Cobbett's <i>Weekly Register</i> (August 17, 1822, vol. 43, pp. 389-425). The
"eulogy" was in perfectly good taste, but there can be little doubt that
if "Waddington or Watson" had cut <i>their</i> "carotid arteries," the
verdict would have been different.]</p></div>

[The phrase, "great moral lesson," was employed by the Duke of
Wellington, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of the restoration of pictures and statues to
their "rightful owners," in a despatch addressed to Castlereagh, under
date, Paris, September 19, 1815 (<i>The Dispatches, etc.</i> (ed. by Colonel
Gurwood), 1847, viii. 270). The words, "moral lesson," as applied to the
French generally, are to be found in Scott's <i>Field of Waterloo</i>
(conclusion, stanza vi. line 3), which was written about the same time
as the despatch. Byron quotes them in his "Ode from the French," stanza
iv. line 8 (see <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1900, iii. 434, note 1). There is a
satirical allusion to the Duke's "assumption of the didactic" about
teaching a "great moral lesson" in the Preface to the first number of
the <i>Liberal</i> (1822, p. xi.).]</p></div>

replied, "Orthodoxy, my lord, is <i>my doxy</i>, and heterodoxy is <i>another

out in their sacred costume, with his whiskers shaved; and, as he
possessed good features, he was declared to be one of the best-looking

Andrault, Comte de Langeron, born at Paris, January 13, 1763, on the
outbreak of the Revolution (1790) took service in the Russian Army. He
fought against the Swedes in 1790, and the Turks in 1791, and, after
serving as a volunteer in the army of the Duke of Brunswick (1792-93),
returned to Russia, and was raised to the rank of general in 1799. He
commanded a division of the Russian Army in the German campaign of 1813,
and entered Paris with Bl&uuml;cher, March 30, 1814. He was afterwards
Governor of Odessa and of New Russia; and, a second time, fought against
the Turks in 1828. He died at St. Petersburg, July 4, 1831. Joseph
Elizabeth Roger, Comte de Damas d'Antigny, born at Paris, September 4,
1765, owed his commission in the Russian Army to the influence of the
Prince de Ligne. He fought against the Turks in 1787-88, and was
distinguished for bravery and daring. At the Restoration in 1814 he
re-entered the French Army, was made Governor of Lyons; shared the
temporary exile of Louis XVIII. at Ghent in 1815, and, in the following
year, as commandant of a division, took part in repressing the
revolutionary disturbances in the central and southern departments of
France. He died at Cirey, September 3, 1823.&mdash;<i>La Grande

died October 15, 1791. "He alighted from his carriage in the midst of
the highway, threw himself on the grass, and died under a tree" (<i>Life
of Catherine II</i>., by W. Tooke, 1880, iii. 324). His character has been
drawn by Louis Philippe, Comte de S&eacute;gur, who, writes Tooke (<i>ibid</i>., p.
326), "lived a long time in habits of intimacy with him, and was so
obliging as to delineate it at our solicitation." "In his person were
collected the most opposite defects and advantages of every kind. He was
avaricious and ostentatious, ... haughty and obliging, politic and
confiding, licentious and superstitious, bold and timid, ambitious and
indiscreet; lavish of his bounties to his relations, his mistresses, and
his favourites, yet frequently paying neither his household nor his
creditors. His consequence always depended on a woman, and he was always
unfaithful to her. Nothing could equal the activity of his mind, nor the
indolence of his body. No dangers could appal his courage; no
difficulties force him to abandon his projects. But the success of an
enterprise always brought on disgust.... Everything with him was
desultory; business, pleasure, temper, carriage. His presence was a
restraint on every company. He was morose to all that stood in awe of
him, and caressed all such as accosted him with familiarity.... None had
read less than he; few people were better informed.... One while he
formed the project of becoming Duke of Courland; at another he thought
of bestowing on himself the crown of Poland. He frequently gave
intimations of an intention to make himself a bishop, or even a simple
monk. He built a superb palace, and wanted to sell it before it was
finished. In his youth he had pleased her [Catherine] by the ardour of
his passion, by his valour, and by his masculine beauty.... Become the
rival of Orloff, he performed for his sovereign whatever the most
romantic passion could inspire. He put out his eye, to free it from a
blemish which diminished his beauty. Banished by his rival, he ran to
meet death in battle, and returned with glory."]</p></div>

follows:&mdash;
</p><p>
"L'arriv&eacute;e du comte Souvorow produisit un grand effet parmi les
troupes.... La mani&egrave;re d'&ecirc;tre plus que simple, puis-qu'il logeait sous
une canonni&egrave;re, et qu'il n'avait pas m&ecirc;me de chaises dans sa tente, son
affabilit&eacute;, sa bonhomie lui conciliaient l'affection de tous les
individus de son arm&eacute;e. Cet homme singulier qui ressemble plus &agrave; un chef
de cosaques ou de Tartares, qu'au g&eacute;n&eacute;ral d'une arm&eacute;e europ&eacute;enne, est
dou&eacute; d'une intr&eacute;pidit&eacute; et d'une hardiesse peu communes....
La mani&egrave;re de vivre, de s'habiller et de parler du comte Souvorow, est aussi
singuli&egrave;re que ses opinions militaires.... II mangeait dans sa tente
assis par terre autour d'une natte sur laquelle il prenait le plus
d&eacute;testable repas. L'apr&egrave;s-midi, un semblable repas lui servait de
souper, il s'endormait ensuite pendant quelques heures, passait une
partie de la nuit &agrave; chanter, et a la pointe du jour il sortait presque
nu et se roulait sur l'herbe assurant que cet exercice lui &eacute;tait
necessaire pour le pr&eacute;server des rhumatismes.... Sa mani&egrave;re de
s'exprimer dans toutes les langues est aussi singuli&egrave;re que toute sa
fa&ccedil;on d'&ecirc;tre, ses phrases sont incoh&eacute;rentes, et s'il n'est pas insens&eacute;,
il dit et fait du moins tout ce qu'il faut pour le para&icirc;tre; mais il est
heureux et cette qualit&eacute; dont le Cardinal Mazarin faisait tant de cas,
est, &agrave; bon droit, fort estim&eacute;e de l'Imp&eacute;ratrice et du Prince Potemkin
... Le moment de l'arriv&eacute;e du Comte Souvorow fut annonc&eacute; par une
d&eacute;charge g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des batteries ou camp et de la flotte."&mdash;<i>Journal de mon

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_408" id="Footnote_408"></a><a href="#FNanchor_408"><span class="label">[408]</span></a> [For a detailed account of Suv&oacute;roff's personal
characteristics, see <i>The Life of Field-Marshal Souvaroff</i>, by L.M.P.
Tranchant de Laverne, 1814, pp. 267-291; and <i>Suv&oacute;roff</i>, by
Lieut.-Colonel Spalding, 1890, pp. 222-229.
</p><p>
Byron's epithet "buffoon" (line 5) may, perhaps, be traced to the
following anecdote recorded by Tranchant de Laverne (p. 281): "During
the first war of Poland ... he published, in the order of the day, that
at the first crowing of the cock the troops would march to attack the
enemy, and caused the spy to send word that the Russians would be upon
them some time after midnight. But about eight o'clock Souvarof ran
through the camp, imitating the crowing of a cock.... The enemy,
completely surprised, lost a great number of men."
</p><p>
For his "praying" (line 6), <i>vide ibid.</i>, pp. 272, 273: "He made a short
prayer after each meal, and again when going to bed. He usually
performed his devotions before an image of St. Nicholas, the patron
saint of Russia."
</p><p>
"Half-dirt" (line 5) is, however, a calumny (<i>ibid</i>. p. 272): "It was
his custom to rise at the earliest dawn; several buckets of cold water
were thrown over his naked body."
</p><p>
The same writer (p. 268) repudiates the charges of excessive barbarity
and cruelty brought against Suv&oacute;roff by C.F.P. Masson, in his <i>M&eacute;moires
Secrets sur la Russie</i> (<i>vide</i>, e.g., ed. 1800, i. 311): "Souvorow ne
scroit que le plus ridicule bouffon, s'il n'&eacute;toit pas montr&eacute; le plus
barbare guerrier. C'est un monstre, qui renferme dans le corps d'un
singe l'&acirc;me d'un chien de boucher. Attila, son compatriote, et don't il
descend, peut-&ecirc;tre ne fut ni si heureux, ni si f&eacute;roce."
</p><p>
Suv&oacute;roff did not regard himself as "half-demon." "Your pencil," he
reminded the artist M&uuml;ller, "will delineate the features of my face.
These are visible: but my inner man is hidden. I must tell you that I
have shed rivers of blood. I tremble, but I love my neighbour. In my
whole life I have made no one unhappy; not an insect hath perished by my
hand. I was little; I was big. In fortune's ebb and flow, relying on
God, I stood immovable&mdash;even as now." (<i>Suv&oacute;roff</i>, 1890, p. 228,
note.)]</p></div>

settler, George Boone, of Exeter. His great work in life was the
conquest of Kentucky. Following in the steps of another pioneer, John
Finley, he left his home in North Carolina in May, 1769, and, after
numerous adventures, effected a settlement on the Kentucky river. He
constructed a fort, which he named Boonesborough, and carried on a
protracted campaign with varying but final success against the Indians.
When Kentucky was admitted into the Union, February 4, 1791, he failed
to make good his title to his property at Boonesborough, and withdrew to
Mount Pleasant, beyond the Ohio. Thence, in 1795, he removed to
Missouri, then a Spanish possession. Napoleon wrested Missouri from the
Spaniards, only to sell the territory to the United States, with the
result that in 1810 he was confirmed in the possession of 850 out of the
8000 acres which he had acquired in 1795. "Boone was then seventy-five
years of age, hale and strong. The charm of the hunter's life clung to
him to the last, and in his eighty-second year he went on a hunting
excursion to the mouth of the Kansas river."&mdash;Appleton's <i>Encyclopedia,
etc</i>., art. "Boone." His fine and gracious nature reveals itself in his
autobiography (<i>The Adventures of Colonel Daniel Boon, Formerly a
Hunter; Containing a Narrative of the Wars of Kentucky</i>; Imlay's <i>North
America</i>, 1793, ii. 52-54). "One day," he writes (pp. 330, <i>sq</i>.), "I
undertook a tour through the country, and the diversity and beauties of
nature ... expelled every gloomy and vexatious thought. Just at the
close of day the gentle gales retired, and left the place to the
disposal of a profound calm. Not a breeze shook the most tremulous leaf.
I had gained the summit of a commanding ridge, and, looking round with
astonishing delight, beheld the ample plains, the beauteous tracts
below. On the other hand, I surveyed the famous river Ohio, that rolled
in silent dignity, marking the western boundary of Kentucky with
inconceivable grandeur. ... All things were still. I kindled a fire near
a fountain of sweet water, and feasted on the loins of a buck, which a
few hours before I had killed.... No populous city, with all the
varieties of commerce and stately structures, could afford so much
pleasure to my mind as the beauties of nature I found here." (See, too,
<i>The Kentucky Pioneers</i>, by John Brown, <i>Harper's New Monthly Magazine</i>,
1887, vol. lxxv. pp. 48-71.)]</p></div>

It may be noted that Lorenzo Bartolini, the Italian sculptor who took a

Napoleon, in 1814, to design marble vases for a terrace at Elba, which
were to be illuminated at night "from within."]</p></div>

[J.H. Cast&eacute;ra (<i>Vie de Catherine II.</i>, 1797, ii. 374) relates this
incident in connection with the fall of Turtukey (or Tutrakaw) in
Bulgaria, giving the words in French, "Gloire &agrave; Dieu! Louange &agrave;
Catherine! Toutoukai est pris. Souwaroff y est entr&eacute;." W. Tooke (<i>Life
of Catherine II.</i>, 1800, iii. 278). Cast&eacute;ra's translator, gives the
original Russian with an English version. But according to Spalding
(<i>Suv&oacute;roff</i>, 1890, pp. 42, 43), the words, which were written on a scrap
of paper, and addressed to Soltikoff, ran thus: "Your Excellency, we
have conquered. Glory to God! Glory to you! Alexander Suv&oacute;roff." When
Ismail was taken he wrote to Potemkin, "The Russian standard floats
above the walls of Ismail," and to the Empress, "Proud Ismail lies at
your Majesty's feet." The tenour of the poetical message on the fall of
Tutrakaw recalls the triumphant piety of the Emperor William I. of
Germany. See, too, for "mad Suwarrow's rhymes," Canto IX. stanza lx.
lines 1-4.]</p></div>

from the <i>Letter to the Duke of Wellington on the Arrest of M. Marinet</i>,
by Lord Kinnaird, 1818. The story, which is full of interest, may be
briefly recounted. On January 30, 1818, Lord Kinnaird informed Sir
George Murray (Chief of the Staff of the Army of Occupation) that a
person, whose name he withheld, had revealed to him the existence of a
plot to assassinate the Duke of Wellington. At 12.30 a.m., February 11,
1818, the Duke, on returning to his Hotel, was fired at by an unknown
person; and then, but not till then, he wrote to urge Lord Clancarty to
advise the Prince Regent to take steps to persuade or force Kinnaird to
disclose the name of his informant. A Mr. G.W. Chad, of the Consular
Service, was empowered to proceed to Brussels, and to seek an interview
with Kinnaird. He carried with him, among other documents, a letter from
the Duke to Lord Clancarty, dated February 12, 1818. A postscript
contained this intimation: "It may be proper to mention to you that the
French Government are disposed to go every length in the way of
negotiation with the person mentioned by Lord Kinnaird, or others, to
discover the plot."
</p><p>
Kinnaird absolutely declined to give up the name of his informant, but,
acting on the strength of the postscript, which had been read but not
shown to him, started for Paris with "the great unknown." Some days
after their arrival, and while Kinnaird was a guest of the Duke, the man
was arrested, and discovered to be one Nicholle or Marinet, who had been
appointed <i>receveur</i> under the restored government of Louis XVIII., but
during the <i>Cent jours</i> had fled to Belgium, retaining the funds he had
amassed during his term of office. Kinnaird regarded this action of the
French Government as a breach of faith, and in a "Memorial" to the
French Chamber of Peers, and his <i>Letter</i>, maintained that the Duke's
postscript implied a promise of a safe conduct for Marinet to and from
Paris to Brussels. The Duke, on the other hand, was equally positive
(see his letter to Lord Liverpool, May 30, 1818) "that he never intended
to have any negotiations with anybody." Kinnaird was a "dog with a bad
name," He had been accused (see his <i>Letter to the Earl of Liverpool</i>,
1816, p. 16) of "the promulgation of dangerous opinions," and of
intimacy "with persons suspected." The Duke speaks of him as "the friend
of Revolutionists"! It is evident that he held the dangerous doctrine
that a promise to a rogue <i>is</i> a promise, and that the authorities took
a different view of the ethics of the situation. It is clear, too, that
the Duke's postscript was ambiguous, but that it did not warrant the
assumption that if Marinet went to Paris he should be protected. The air
was full of plots. The great Duke despised and was inclined to ignore
the pistol or the dagger of the assassin; but he believed that "mischief
was afoot," and that "great personages" might or might not be
responsible. He was beset by difficulties at every turn, and would have
been more than mortal if he had put too favourable a construction on the
scruples, or condoned the imprudence of a "friend of Revolutionists."]</p></div>

Only one lasts for several months, between the death of Lansko&iuml; (1784)
and the succession of Iermolof.... There is no lack of candidates. The
place is good.... Sometimes, too, on the height by the throne, reached
at a bound, these spoilt children of fate grow giddy.... It is over in
an instant, at an evening reception it is noticed that the Empress has
gazed attentively at some obscure lieutenant, presented but just before
... next day it is reported that he has been appointed aide-de-camp to
her Majesty. What that means is well known. Next day he finds himself in
the special suite of rooms.... The rooms are already vacated, and
everything is prepared for the new-comer. All imaginable comfort and
luxury ... await him; and, on opening a drawer, he finds a hundred
thousand roubles [about &pound;20,000], the usual first gift, a foretaste of
Pactolus. That evening, before the assembled court, the Empress appears,
leaning familiarly on his arm, and on the stroke of ten, as she retires,
the new favourite follows her" (<i>ibid.</i>, pp. 246-249).]</p></div>

and asks, "Is she yet in the land of the living, or does she sing psalms
with the Blessed in the other world?" This was his father's sister,
Sophia Maria, daughter of Admiral the Hon. John Byron. But his "good old
aunt" is, more probably, the Hon. Mrs. Frances Byron, widow of George
(born April 22, 1730) son of the fourth, and brother of the "Wicked"
lord. She was the daughter and co-heiress of Ellis Levett, Esq., and
lived "at Nottingham in her own house." She died, aged 86, June 13,
1822, not long before this Canto was written. She is described in the
obituary notice of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, June, 1822, vol. 92, p.
573, as "Daughter of Vice-Admiral the Hon. John Byron (who sailed round
the world with Lord Anson), grandfather of the present Lord Byron." But
that is, chronologically, impossible. Byron must have retained a
pleasing recollection of the ear-trumpet and the spectacles, and it
gratified his kindlier humour to embalm their owner in his verse.]</p></div>

effect a cure of the muscular contraction of his right leg and foot. He
was consulted by Lady Byron, in 1816, with regard to her husband's
supposed derangement, but was not admitted when he called at the house
in Piccadilly. He is said to have "avoided technical and learned
phrases; to have affected no sentimental tenderness, but expressed what
he had to say in the simplest and plainest terms" (<i>Annual Biography</i>,
1824, p. 319). Jekyll (<i>Letters</i>, 1894, p. 110) repeats or invents an
anecdote that "the old king, in his mad fits, used to say he could bring
any dead people to converse with him, except those who had died under
Baillie's care, for that the doctor always dissected them into so many
morsels, that they had not a leg to walk to Windsor with." It is hardly
necessary to say that John Abernethy (1764-1831) "expressed what <i>he</i>
had to say" in the bluntest and rudest terms at his disposal.]</p></div>

Courland of that name; one of them I remember seeing in England in the
blessed year of the Allies (1814)&mdash;the Duchess of S.&mdash;to whom the
English Duchess of Somerset presented me as a namesake.
</p><p>
["Ernest John Biren was born in Courland [in 1690]. His grandfather had
been head groom to James, the third Duke of Courland, and obtained from
his master the present of a small estate in land.... In 1714 he made his
appearance at St. Petersburg, and solicited the place of page to the
Princess Charlotte, wife of the Tzarovitch Alexey; but being
contemptuously rejected as a person of mean extraction, retired to
Mittau, where he chanced to ingratiate himself with Count Bestuchef,
Master of the Household to Anne, widow of Frederic William, Duke of
Courland, who resided at Mittau. Being of a handsome figure and polite
address, he soon gained the good will of the duchess, and became her
secretary and chief favourite. On her being declared sovereign of
Russia, Anne called Biren to Petersburg, and the secretary soon became
Duke of Courland, and first minister or rather despot of Russia. On the
death of Anne, which happened in 1740, Biren, being declared regent,
continued daily increasing his vexations and cruelties, till he was
arrested, on the 18th of December, only twenty days after he had been
appointed to the regency; and at the revolution that ensued he was
exiled to the frozen shores of the Oby." <i>Catherine II.</i>, by W. Tooke,
1800, i. 160, <i>footnote</i>. He was recalled in 1763, and died in 1772.
</p><p>
In a letter to his sister, dated June 18, 1814, Byron gives a slightly
different version of the incident, recorded in his note (<i>vide supra</i>):
"The Duchess of Somerset also, to mend matters, insisted on presenting
me to a Princess <i>Biron</i>, Duchess of Hohen-God-knows-what, and another
person to her two sisters, Birons too. But I flew off, and <i>would</i> not,
saying I had had enough of introductions for that night at
least."&mdash;<i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 98. The "daughters of Courland" must have
been descendants of "Pierre, dernier Duc de Courlande, De la Maison de
Biron," viz. Jeanne Cath&eacute;rine, born June 24, 1783, who married, in 1801,
Fran&ccedil;ois Pignatelli de Belmonte, Duc d'Acerenza, and Doroth&eacute;e, born
August 21, 1793, who married, in 1809, Edmond de Talleyrand P&eacute;rigord,
Duc de Talleyrand, nephew to the Bishop of Autun. (See <i>Almanach de

If there be any gemman so ignorant as to require a traduction, I refer
him to my old friend and corporeal pastor and master, John Jackson,
Esq., Professor of Pugilism; who, I trust, still retains the strength
and symmetry of his model of a form, together with his good humour, and
athletic as well as mental accomplishments.
</p><p>
[Gentleman Jackson was of good renown. "Servility," says Egan (<i>Life in
London</i>, 1823, p. 217), "is not known to him. Flattery he detests.
Integrity, impartiality, good-nature, and manliness, are the
corner-stones of his understanding." Byron once said of him that "his
manners were infinitely superior to those of the Fellows of the College
whom I meet at the high table" (J.W. Clark, <i>Cambridge</i>, 1890, p. 140).
(See, too, letter to John Jackson, September 18, 1808, <i>Letters</i>, 1898,
i. 189, note 2; <i>Hints from Horace</i>, line 638, <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1898,
i. 433, note 3.) As to the stanza quoted by Egan (<i>Anecdotes of the
Turf</i>, 1827, p. 44), but not <i>traduced</i> or interpreted, "To be hobbled
for making a clout" is to be taken into custody for stealing a
handkerchief, to "turn snitch" is to inform, and the "forty" is the &pound;40
offered for the detection of a capital crime, and shared by the police
or Bow Street runners. Dangerous characters were let alone and tacitly
encouraged to continue their career of crime, until the measure of their
iniquity was full, and they "weighed forty." If Jack was clumsy enough
to be detected in a trifling theft, his "blowen" would go over to the
enemy, and betray him for the sake of the Government reward (see
<i>Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</i>, by Francis Grose, 1823,
art. "Weigh forty").]</p></div>

streets and places than meets the eye. Here, as elsewhere, there is, or

bitterly for life,&mdash;to the deaf winds. Only with the third rope (for two
ropes broke, and the quavering voice still pleaded), can he be so much
as got hanged! His Body is dragged through the streets; his Head goes
aloft on a pike, the mouth filled with grass: amid sounds as of Tophet,
from a grass-eating people."]</p></div>

now but a <i>mystery</i>. It was, however, almost so to me when I first
returned from the East in 1811-1812. It means a pretty, a high-born, a
fashionable young female, well instructed by her friends, and furnished
by her milliner with a wardrobe upon credit, to be repaid, when married,
by the <i>husband</i>. The riddle was first read to me by a young and pretty
heiress, on my praising the "drapery" of the <i>"untochered"</i> but "pretty
virginities" (like Mrs. Anne Page) of the <i>then</i> day, which has now been
some years yesterday: she assured me that the thing was common in
London; and as her own thousands, and blooming looks, and rich
simplicity of array, put any suspicion in her own case out of the
question, I confess I gave some credit to the allegation. If necessary,
authorities might be cited; in which case I could quote both "drapery"
and the wearers. Let us hope, however, that it is now obsolete.</p></div>

settled down as a preacher, with the rank of doctor, but of what faculty

the King and the Duke of York as to the right of inheritance of their
father's personal property. George IV. conceived that it devolved upon
him personally, and not on the Crown, and "consequently appropriated to
himself the whole of the money and the jewels." It is possible that this
difference between the brothers was noised abroad, and that old stories

inheritance, which was to know him no more, is sketched from memory, but
it unites the charm of a picture with the accuracy of a ground-plan.
Eight years had gone by since he had looked his last on "venerable arch"
and "lucid lake" (see "Epistle to Augusta," stanza viii. lines 7, 8),
but he had not forgotten, he could not forget, that enchanted and
enchanting scene.
</p><p>
Newstead Abbey or Priory was founded by Henry II., by way of deodand or
expiation for the murder of Thomas Becket. Lands which bordered the
valley of the Leen, and which had formed part of Sherwood Forest, were
assigned for the use and endowment of a chapter of "black canons regular
of the order of St. Augustine," and on a site, by the river-side to the
south of the forest uplands (stanza lv. lines 5-8) the new stede, or
place, or station, arose. It was a "Norman Abbey" (stanza lv. line 1)
which the Black Canons dedicated to Our Lady, and, here and there, in
the cloisters, traces of Norman architecture remain, but the enlargement
and completion of the monastery was carried out in successive stages and
"transition periods," in a style or styles which, perhaps, more by hap
than by cunning, Byron rightly named "mixed Gothic" (stanza lv. line 4).
To work their mills, and perhaps to drain the marshy valley, the monks
dammed the Leen and excavated a chain of lakes&mdash;the largest to the
north-west, Byron's "lucid lake;" a second to the south of the Abbey;
and a third, now surrounded with woods, and overlooked by the "wicked
lord's" "ragged rock" below the Abbey, half a mile to the south-east.
The "cascade," which flows over and through a stone-work sluice, and
forms a rocky water-fall, issues from the upper lake, and is in full
view of the west front of the Abbey. Almost at right angles to these
lakes are three ponds: the Forest Pond to the north of the stone wall,
which divides the garden from the forest; the square "Eagle" Pond in the
Monks' Garden; and the narrow stew-pond, bordered on either side with
overhanging yews, which drains into the second or Garden Lake. Byron
does not enlarge on this double chain of lakes and ponds, and, perhaps
for the sake of pictorial unity, converts the second (if a second then
existed) and third lakes into a river.
</p><p>
The Abbey, which, at the dissolution of monasteries in 1539, was handed
over by Henry VIII. to Sir John Byron, "steward and warden of the forest
of Shirewood," was converted, here and there, more or less, into a
baronial "mansion" (stanza lxvi.). It is, roughly speaking, a square
block of buildings, flanking the sides of a grassy quadrangle.
Surrounding the quadrangle are two-storied cloisters, and in the centre
a "Gothic fountain" (stanza lxv. line 1) of composite workmanship. The
upper portion of the stonework is hexagonal, and is ornamented with a
double row of gargoyles (all "monsters" and no "saints," recalling,
perhaps identical with, the "seven deadly sins" gargoyles, still <i>in
situ</i> in the quadrangle of Magdalen College, Oxford); the lower half,
which belongs to the seventeenth or eighteenth century, is hollowed into
niches of a Roman or classical design. (In Byron's time the fountain
stood in a courtyard in front of the Abbey, but before he composed this
canto it had been restored by Colonel Wildman to its original place
within the quadrangle. Byron was acquainted with the change, and writes
accordingly.) When the Byrons took possession of the Abbey the upper
stories of the cloisters were converted, on three sides of the
quadrangle, into galleries, and on the fourth, the north side, into a
library. Abutting on the cloisters are the monastic buildings proper, in
part transformed, but with "much of the monastic" preserved. On the
west, the front of the Abbey, the ground floor consists of the entrance
hall and Monks' Parlour, and, above, the Guests' Refectory or
Banqueting-hall, and the Prior's Parlour. On the south, the Xenodochium
or Guesten Hall, and, above, the Monks' Refectory, or Grand
Drawing-room; on the south and east, on the ground floor, the Prior's
Lodgings, the Chapter House ("the exquisite small chapel," stanza lxvi.
line 5), the "slype" or passage between church and Chapter House; and in
the upper story, the state bedrooms, named after the kings, Edward III.,
Henry VII., etc., who, by the terms of the grant of land to the Prior
and Canons, were entitled to free quarters in the Abbey. During Byron's
brief tenure of Newstead, and for long years before, these "huge halls,
long galleries, and spacious chambers" (stanza lxxvii. line 1) were half
dismantled, and in a more or less ruinous condition. A few pictures
remained on the walls of the Great Drawing-room, of the Prior's Parlour,
and in the apartments of the south-east wing or annexe, which dates from
the seventeenth century (see the account of a visit to Newstead in 1812,
in <i>Beauties of England and Wales</i>, 1813, xii. 401-405). There are and
were portraits, by Lely (stanza lxviii. line 7), of a Lady Byron, of
Fanny Jennings, Duchess of Tyrconnel, "loveliness personified," of Mrs.
Hughes, and of Nell Gwynne; by Sir Godfrey Kneller, of William and Mary;
by unnamed artists, of George I. and George II.; and by Ramsay, of
George III. There are portraits of a fat Prior, William Sandall, with a
jewelled reliquary; of "Sir John the Little with the Great Beard," who
ruled in the Prior's stead; and there is the portrait, a votive tablet
of penitence and remorse, "of that Lord Arundel Who struck in heat the
child he loved so well" (see "A Picture at Newstead," by Matthew Arnold,
<i>Poetical Works</i>, 1890, p. 177); but of portraits of judges or bishops,
or of pictures by old masters, there is neither trace nor record.

But the characteristic feature of Newstead Abbey, so familiar that
description seems unnecessary, and, yet, never quite accurately
described, is the west front of the Priory Church, which is in line with
the west front of the Abbey. "Half apart," the southern portion of this
front, which abuts on the windows of the Prior's Parlour, and the room
above, where Byron slept, flanks and conceals the west end of the north
cloisters and library; but, with this exception, it is a screen, and
nothing more. In the centre is the "mighty window" (stanza lxii. line
1), shorn of glass and tracery; above are six lancet windows (which
Byron seems to have regarded as niches), and, above again, in a "higher
niche" (stanza lxi. line 1), is the crowned Virgin with the Babe in her
arms, which escaped, as by a miracle, the "fiery darts"&mdash;the shot and
cannon-balls of the Cromwellian troopers. On either side of the central
window are "two blank windows containing tracery ['geometrical
decorated'] ... carved [in relief] on the solid ashlar;" on either side
of the window, and at the northern and southern extremities of the
front, are buttresses with canopied niches, in each of which a saint or
apostle must once have stood. Over the west door there is the mutilated
figure of (?) the Saviour, but of twelve saints or twelve niches there
is no trace. The "grand arch" is an ivy-clad screen, and nothing more.
Behind and beyond, in place of vanished nave, of aisle and transept, is
the smooth green turf; and at the east end, on the site of the high
altar, stands the urn-crowned masonry of Boatswain's tomb.
</p><p>
Newstead Abbey was sold by Lord Byron to his old schoolfellow, Colonel
Thomas Wildman, in November, 1817. The house and property were resold in
1861, by his widow, to William Frederick Webb, Esq., a traveller in many
lands, the friend and host of David Livingstone. At his death the estate
was inherited by his daughter, Miss Geraldine Webb, who was married to
General Sir Herbert Charles Chermside, G.C.M.G., etc., Governor of
Queensland, in 1899.

finished. But, if not, an incident which took place in the House of

be quoted in corroboration of Brougham's unreadiness with regard to the
point of honour. In the course of his speech he accused Canning of
"monstrous truckling for the purpose of obtaining office," and Canning,
without waiting for Brougham to finish, gave him the lie: "I rise to say

There was a "scene," which ended in an exchange of explanations and

Spirit of the Age</i>, 1825, pp. 302, 303: "He [Brougham] is adventurous,
but easily panic-struck, and sacrifices the vanity of self-opinion to
the necessity of self-preservation ... himself the first to get out of
harm's way and escape from the danger;" and Mr. Parthenopex Puff (W.
Stewart Rose), in <i>Vivian Grey</i> (1826, i. 186, 187), "Oh! he's a
prodigious fellow! What do you think Booby says? he says, that Foaming
Fudge [Brougham] can do more than any man in Great Britain; that he had

sentimental savage, whom it is a mode to quote (amongst the novelists)
to show their sympathy for innocent sports and old songs, teaches how to
sew up frogs, and break their legs by way of experiment, in addition to
the art of angling,&mdash;the cruelest, the coldest, and the stupidest of
pretended sports. They may talk about the beauties of nature, but the
angler merely thinks of his dish of fish; he has no leisure to take his
eyes from off the streams, and a single <i>bite</i> is worth to him more than
all the scenery around. Besides, some fish bite best on a rainy day. The
whale, the shark, and the tunny fishery have somewhat of noble and
perilous in them; even net fishing, trawling, etc., are more humane and
useful. But angling!&mdash;no angler can be a good man.

"One of the best men I ever knew,&mdash;as humane, delicate-minded, generous,
and excellent a creature as any in the world,&mdash;was an angler: true, he
angled with painted flies, and would have been incapable of the
extravagancies of I. Walton."

mentioned that somebody, regretting the loss of a friend, was answered
by an universal Pylades: "When I lose one, I go to the Saint James's
Coffee-house, and take another." I recollect having heard an anecdote of
the same kind.&mdash;Sir W.D. was a great gamester. Coming in one day to the
Club of which he was a member, he was observed to look
melancholy.&mdash;"What is the matter, Sir William?" cried Hare, of facetious
memory.&mdash;"Ah!" replied Sir W., "I have just lost poor Lady D."&mdash;"Lost!
What at? Quinze or Hazard?" was the consolatory rejoinder of the
querist.

Mount Cyllene, wantonly stamped with his heel on a pair of snakes, and
was straightway turned into a woman. Seven years later he was led to
treat another pair of snakes in like fashion, and, happily or otherwise,
was turned back into a man. Hence, when Jupiter and Juno fell to
wrangling on the comparative enjoyments of men and women, the question
was referred to Tiresias, as a person of unusual experience and
authority. He gave it in favour of the woman, and Juno, who was
displeased at his answer, struck him with blindness. But Jupiter, to
make amends, gave him the "liberty of prophesying" for seven, some say
nine, generations. (See Ovid, <i>Metam.</i>, iii. 320; and Thomas Muncker's
notes on the <i>Fabulae</i> of Hyginus, No. lxxv. ed. 1681, pp. 126-128.)]</p></div>

to better account." Others, however, gave him encouragement. See, for

perhaps, Byron derived his knowledge of "Mysteries and Moralities"),

their customs was to keep watch by nights and to cry the hours to this

to 1827, sat as judge (November 7, 1822) to hear the petition of Henry
Wallop Fellowes, that a commission of inquiry should be issued to
ascertain whether his uncle, Lord Portsmouth (who married Mary Anne
Hanson, the daughter of Byron's solicitor), was of sound mind, "and
capable of managing his own person and property." The Chancellor gave
judgment that a commission be issued, and the jury, February, 1823,
returned a verdict that Lord Portsmouth had been a lunatic since 1809.

[Bayle (see art. "Hobbes" [<i>Dict. Crit. and Hist.</i>, 1736, iii. 471, note
N.]) quotes from <i>Vita Hobb.</i>, p. 106: "He was as falsely accused by
some of being unwilling to be alone, because he was afraid of spectres
and apparitions, vain bugbears of fools, which he had chased away by the
light of his Philosophy," and proceeds to argue that, perhaps, after
all, Hobbes was afraid of the dark. "He was timorous to the last degree,
and consequently he had reason to distrust his imagination when he was
alone in a chamber in the night; for in spite of him the memory of what
he had read and heard concerning apparitions would revive, though he was
not persuaded of the reality of these things." See, however, for his own
testimony that he was "not afrayd of sprights," <i>Letters and Lives of
Eminent Persons</i>, by John Aubrey, 1813, vol. ii. pt. ii. p. 624.]</p></div>

here, his memory played him false, or his art kept him true. The Black
Friar walked and walks in the Guests' Refectory (or Banqueting Hall, or
"Gallery" of this stanza), which adjoins the Prior's Parlour, but the
room where Byron slept (in a four-post bed-a coronet, at each corner,
atop) is on the floor above the Prior's Parlour, and can only be
approached by a spiral staircase. Both rooms look west, and command a
view of the "lake's billow" and the "cascade." Moreover, the Guests'
Refectory was never hung with "old pictures." It would seem that Don
Juan (perhaps Byron on an emergency) slept in the Prior's Parlour, and
that in the visionary Newstead the pictures forsook the Grand
Drawing-Room for the Hall. Hence the scene! <i>El Libertado</i> steps out of

"is worth seeing as a ruin, and I can assure you there <i>was</i> some fun
there, even in my time; but that is past. The ghosts, however, and the
Gothics, and the waters, and the desolation, make it very lively still."
"It was," comments Moore (<i>Life</i>, p. 262, note 1), "if I mistake not,
during his recent visit to Newstead, that he himself actually fancied he
saw the ghost of the Black Friar, which was supposed to have haunted the
Abbey from the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, and which he
thus describes from the recollection, perhaps, of his own fantasy, in
<i>Don Juan</i>.... It is said that the Newstead ghost appeared, also, to
Lord Byron's cousin, Miss Fanny Parkins, and that she made a sketch of
him from memory." The legend of the Black Friar may, it is believed at
Newstead (<i>et vide post</i>, <a href="#songs2">"Song," stanza ii</a>. line 5, p. 583), be traced
to the alarm and suspicion of the country-folk, who, on visiting the
Abbey, would now and then catch sight of an aged lay-brother, or monkish
domestic, who had been retained in the service of the Byrons long after
the Canons had been "turned adrift." He would naturally keep out of
sight of a generation who knew not monks, and, when surprised in the
cloisters or ruins of the church, would glide back to his own quarters
in the dormitories.]</p></div>

The devil looked over Lincoln because the unexampled height of the
central tower of the cathedral excited his envy and alarm; or, as Fuller
(<i>Worthies: Lincolnshire</i>) has it, "overlooked this church, when first
finished, with a torve and tetrick countenance, as maligning men's
costly devotions." So, at least, the vanity of later ages interpreted
the saying; but a time was when the devil "looked over" Lincoln to some
purpose, for in A.D. 1185 an earthquake clave the Church of Remigius in
twain, and in 1235 a great part of the central tower, which had been
erected by Bishop Hugh de Wells, fell and injured the rest of the
building.]</p></div>

["That he was fully aware not only of the abundance of this quality in

singleness of character, did not require the note on this passage to
assure us. The consciousness, indeed, of his own natural tendency to
yield thus to every chance impression, and change with every passing
impulse, was not only for ever present in his mind, but ... had the
effect of keeping him in that general line of consistency, on certain
great subjects, which ... he continued to preserve throughout
life."&mdash;<i>Life</i>, p. 646. "Mobility" is not the tendency to yield to
<i>every</i> impression, to change with <i>every</i> impulse, but the capability
of being moved by many and various impressions, of responding to an
ever-renewed succession of impulses. Byron is defending the enthusiastic
temperament from the charge of inconstancy and insincerity.]</p></div>

More than one "Seventeenth
Canto," or so-called continuation of <i>Don Juan</i>, has been published.
Some of these "Sequels" pretend to be genuine, while others are
undisguisedly imitations or parodies. For an account of these spurious
and altogether worthless continuations, see "Bibliography," vol. vii.
There was, however, a foundation for the myth. Before Byron left Italy
he had begun (May 8, 1823) a seventeenth canto, and when he sailed for
Greece he took the new stanzas with him. Trelawny found "fifteen stanzas
of the seventeenth canto of <i>Don Juan</i>" in Byron's room at Missolonghi
(<i>Recollections, etc.</i>, 1858, p. 237). The MS., together with other
papers, was handed over to John Cam Hobhouse, and is now in the
possession of his daughter, the Lady Dorchester. The copyright was
purchased by the late John Murray. The fourteen (not fifteen) stanzas
are now printed and published for the first time.]</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
